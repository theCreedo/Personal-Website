Started on 4/6/16 for \*Freetail Hacker's 30-day Git Challenge\* :smile:

4/7/16 - 5/7/16

**Day 1:** Started!

**Day 3:** Working on practicing committing with a couple of friends. Some of them have already forgetten to commit :anguished: Luckily there are few that are still going at it hard! :grimacing:

**Day 4:** Attempted to work on css by adding a background photo of my face that stays stagnant while I scrolled. Ended up filling the whole webpage with my forehead. I ended up botching that idea.

**Day 5:** Added several additional css elements. Changed the color of the fonts and attempted to add borders to quotes. Also implemented text-decoration, but it really just looks like a mess right now. Need to format quotes to stay inside of the border, or have the border stay around the quotes. I also added a new html page in order to go to the Snail Tale game. Unfortunately it didn't work out well, so I just have a new page with the description of the game.

**Day 6:** Made the the profile picture hoverable. Unfortunately, I can't resize the image so it shows only the background of the picture rather than me in it. I also fixed the links so that the they can be underlined when hovered over.

**Day 7:** Fixing the image resizing. Did not fix it.

**Day 8:** Added new links to resume and personal projects/descriptions with reformatted coloring.

**Day 9:** Reordered Information in home page. Added more projects into the personal projects html part.

**Day 10:** Added Education and Technical Skill info. Made 404.html viewable with red background (hopefully).

**Day 12:** Added About Me info with links to organizations I volunteer or go to.

**Day 13:** Played around with adding a picture, changed fonts, and formatted the website to look more aesthetic (even though it looks the same as always). There are now only 4 people total who are still going strong on the challenge ._. I've almost forgotten to remind some people, but some of them are very self-motivated.

**Day 14:** Trying out a style format with different parts, and hoping to add a good format that has a navigation bar and cool color styling.

**Day 15:** Trying to implement style format across all parts of website (only two). Reformatting website to look more aesthetic.

**Day 16:** Add words in 404.html

**Day 17:** Add images to the personal projects in order to show the game for Snail Tale, along with a downloadable jar file that people can play. Also added a Copyright symbol in order to make the website look official.

**Day 18:** Correct sizing of images to show the Snail Tale game and edited the position for the copyright symbol.

**Day 19:** Added a new page to show some fun stuff that I like to say/do such as puns!
