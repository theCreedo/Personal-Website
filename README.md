Started on 4/6/16 for \*Freetail Hacker's 30-day Git Challenge\* :smile:

4/7/16 - 5/7/16

Day 1: Started!

Day 3: Working on practicing committing with a couple of friends. Some of them have already forgetten to commit :anguished: Luckily there are few that are still going at it hard! :grimacing:

Day 4: Attempted to work on css by adding a background photo of my face that stays stagnant while I scrolled. Ended up filling the whole webpage with my forehead. I ended up botching that idea.
