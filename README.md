Started on 4/6/16 for \*Freetail Hacker's 30-day Git Challenge\* :smile:

4/7/16 - 5/7/16

**Day 1:** Started!

**Day 3:** Working on practicing committing with a couple of friends. Some of them have already forgetten to commit :anguished: Luckily there are few that are still going at it hard! :grimacing:

**Day 4:** Attempted to work on css by adding a background photo of my face that stays stagnant while I scrolled. Ended up filling the whole webpage with my forehead. I ended up botching that idea.

**Day 5:** Added several additional css elements. Changed the color of the fonts and attempted to add borders to quotes. Also implemented text-decoration, but it really just looks like a mess right now. Need to format quotes to stay inside of the border, or have the border stay around the quotes. I also added a new html page in order to go to the Snail Tale game. Unfortunately it didn't work out well, so I just have a new page with the description of the game.

**Day 6:** Made the the profile picture hoverable. Unfortunately, I can't resize the image so it shows only the background of the picture rather than me in it. I also fixed the links so that the they can be underlined when hovered over.

**Day 7:** Fixing the image resizing.
